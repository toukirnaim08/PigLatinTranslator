SATURDAY football is king again in Adelaide.  And the Crows and Power want more of the three Saturday timeslots rather than be the AFL's guinea pig for Monday night football. The AFL's entry to the new Adelaide Oval begins next week with a Saturday twilight Showdown - and this could become the "signature timeslot" at the Oval. But most surprising on market research is SA football fans wanting the Oval to host AFL games in the traditional Saturday afternoon hours - more so than the league's premier platform of Friday Night Football! "Ten years ago," Adelaide chief executive Steven Trigg said, "you would avoid asking for Saturday afternoon football at all costs!" That has changed now. Saturday night is the best timeslot if you want to fill the ground. Saturday afternoon works far better than it ever has! "And Saturday twilight could emerge as the most popular as fans build their day in the city around the footy at the Oval." Port Adelaide chief executive Keith Thomas notes some of the Power's best crowds at the unpopular AAMI Stadium last year were on Saturdays, including the 45,127 at the season closer against Carlton on Saturday afternoon. The Advertiser Footy Fans Survey reaffirms this. SA-based supporters declare the three Saturday timeslots are among their top-four preferences. Friday Night Football is at number three behind Saturday night and Saturday afternoon. But the growing anticipation the AFL's telecasters have not given up copying the ultra-popular American model of Monday Night Football - and want Adelaide to be the new test field - is not comforting either the Adelaide or Port Adelaide football clubs.
